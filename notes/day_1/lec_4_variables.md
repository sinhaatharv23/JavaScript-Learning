This var, let and const are used to declare variables in JavaScript.
They are basically stored in the memory of the computer.
1.const : The value of a variable declared with const cannot be changed later in the code. It is a constant.
2.let : The value of a variable declared with let can be changed later in the code.
3.var : The value of a variable declared with var can also be changed later in the code.We dont use var nowadays, as they dont have scope'{}'(curly braces is the scope).
4.Without var, let or const : If we declare a variable without var, let or const, it becomes a global variable and can be accessed from anywhere in the code.


[NOTE:-If we dont wanna write again and again the console.log() then we can use another way to print multiple variables at once i.e. console.table();]

See the tutorial-code.
