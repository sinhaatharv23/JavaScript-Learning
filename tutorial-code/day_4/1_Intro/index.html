             => To see only essential documents of windows , we can go to any web page and just right click, and at the bottom there'll be an inspect option, we'll select that
             and then we'll go to consoele, and then in console we'll just type:- console.log(document) to see essential documents.
             However,to see hidden documents too , we'll type in console:- console.dir(document), here we'll be getting JQuery , location etc etc
