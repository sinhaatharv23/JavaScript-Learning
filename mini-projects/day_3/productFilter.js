/*
🚀 MINI PROJECT — “Product Filter App”

Create folder:

mini-projects/day_3/
productFilter.js

Given:
const products = [
  { name: "Laptop", price: 50000, rating: 4.5 },
  { name: "Phone", price: 20000, rating: 4.1 },
  { name: "Tablet", price: 15000, rating: 3.9 },
  { name: "Monitor", price: 12000, rating: 4.3 }
];

Tasks:

✔ Filter products price > 15000
✔ Map → return only product names
✔ Reduce → total cost
✔ Find product with rating > 4.3
✔ Chain filter + map to get names of expensive products only

This EXACT logic is used in React apps (E-commerce filters).
